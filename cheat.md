For 05/03/2024 exam =)

> Hello! My name is Bảo, and I’m 16 years old. I come from Vietnam, and I’m currently studying at Yên Mô A High School. I’m an outgoing person who loves learning new things and meeting new people. Nice to meet you!

# 1. Do you know any international organization?

Yeah, of course! I know many international organizations, like the United Nations (UN), ASEAN, WHO, and WTO. They play an important role in global peace, economy, and development.

# 2. Please tell me about an international organization that you know.

Well, I want to talk about the United Nations (UN). It was founded on October 24, 1945, in San Francisco, USA, and now has 193 member countries, including Vietnam.
The UN aims to maintain peace, protect human rights, and support global development. It carries out many activities, like helping poor countries, providing education, and tackling climate change.
For Vietnam, the UN has done a lot, you know. It has supported poverty reduction, healthcare, and environmental protection. For example, WHO provided vaccines and medical support during COVID-19, which was really helpful.

# 3. Among the international organizations you know, which one do you like most?

I think I like ASEAN the most. I mean, it’s an organization that brings Southeast Asian countries together, helping them grow economically and culturally. Plus, Vietnam is an active member, so it benefits a lot.

# 4. Why has Vietnam become one of the most popular destinations in Southeast Asia for foreigners recently?

Well, there are many reasons! First, Vietnam has amazing landscapes, like Ha Long Bay and Hoi An. Second, the food is delicious, you know, like pho, banh mi, and fresh seafood. Also, it’s affordable and people here are friendly. That’s why more and more foreigners love visiting Vietnam.

# 5. What are the benefits for Vietnam as a member of international organizations?

Oh, there are so many benefits! First, Vietnam can trade more and attract foreign investment. Second, it gets support in education, healthcare, and technology. Plus, international organizations help Vietnam improve its diplomatic relationships and have a stronger voice in global issues.

# 6. Please tell me some apps that you have used to support your studying.

Well, I have used several apps to help with my studies. For example, Quizlet is great for memorizing vocabulary and key concepts. Google Docs helps me take notes and collaborate with friends. Also, Notion is really useful for organizing my study schedule and keeping track of assignments.

# 7. Is watching films also a new way of learning?

Yeah, definitely! Watching films can help improve listening skills, vocabulary, and even cultural knowledge. For example, watching English movies helps me get used to natural pronunciation and expressions. Plus, it makes learning more fun and engaging.

# 8. Which do you prefer? Learning online or face-to-face with a teacher?

I think both have advantages, but I prefer face-to-face learning because it’s easier to ask questions, interact with classmates, and stay focused. However, online learning is also convenient, especially when I need to study at my own pace.

# 9. What do you think about blended learning?

I think blended learning is a great idea! It combines the flexibility of online learning with the interaction of traditional classes. This way, I can learn at home but still have direct support from teachers. It’s really effective, especially for busy students.

# 10. Do you use any apps that support English learning?

Yes! I use Duolingo for practicing vocabulary and grammar, BBC Learning English for listening skills, and Grammarly to check my writing. These apps make learning English easier and more enjoyable.
